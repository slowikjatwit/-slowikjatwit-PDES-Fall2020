%\section{Numerical Methods}
\section{Numerical Methods of Solving Partial Differential Equations}
\red{Give a brief overview of this section of the class. The following would be a sample introduction to such a section from an ordinary differential equations class.}

A first order initial value problem takes the form \(\ds \d{y}{t} = f(y,t)\) with \(\ds y(t_0)=y_0\). Such functions are studied in a first class on differential equations in a variety of special cases (e.g. separable equations or linear
equations) but there is no general analytic method that works for every \(f\). We shall explore some numerical methods of finding a solution.

\subsection{Order of Error}
\blue{Explain how you calculate the order of the error in a finite difference approximation scheme here. You should illustrate your explanation by solving at least the problem I gave you to demonstrate mastery. If you wish to include others as well that is up to you. What follows is a sample bit of text discussing the order of the error for the Euler Method of solving ODEs.}

The Euler Method takes the most basic ideas of calculus and uses them to step
through time to find an approximate solution.\\[.2in]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llcll}
Differential equation: & $\ds \d{y}{t} = f(y,t)$ &\phantom{aa} & 
Initial condition: & $y(t_0)=y_0$ \\
&&&& \\
Time interval of solution:& $[t_0, t_1]$ &&
Step size:& $\Delta t$ \\
&&&& \\
Number of steps:& $\ds \frac{t_1-t_0}{\Delta t}$ &&
Iterative step:& $\ds y(t+\Delta t) = f(y(t),t)\Delta
t+y(t)$ \end{tabular}\end{center}
~\\[.2in]

\subsubsection{Error} The error is of order $\Delta t$. In the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$, the error in Euler's
method also goes to 0. In practice, it is impractical to let $\Delta t$ become
too small as you reach limits in your computer's ability to resolve
numbers. You should check on the \emph{machine epsilon} \label{machineepsilon} for your computer and
the limitations of the data type you are using. This is also why you always want to add numbers
from the smallest to the largest on a computer as well to minimize the loss of
precision due to rounding.

Then present the sample problem from the text, with its solution, including reproductions of the graphs, and the sample problem you solved with me for mastery with its solution. Include your code here with clear explanations of what values must be changed to solve the two different problems. What follows is a sample MATLAB program that I wrote as an example of how to include commented code in a \LaTeX file.}

\subsection{Implementing an Implicit Difference Method}
\blue{Explain what an implicit difference method is. Then present the sample problem from the text, with its solution and the sample problem you solved with me for mastery with its solution. Include your code here with clear explanations of what values must be changed to solve the two different problems. What follows is a sample using a block quotation and reference.}

J. D. Lambert described the phenomenon of stiffness for a system of
differential equations as follows:
\begin{quote} If a numerical method with a finite region of absolute stability,
    applied to a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a
    certain interval of integration a steplength which is excessively small in
    relation to the smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the
    system is said to be stiff in that interval. \cite{wikistiff}
    \end{quote}

\section{Method of Characteristics}
\red{Give an introduction to the method of characteristics.}

\subsection{Solving $u_t+cu_x +du = g(x)$ with $u(0,x)=f(x)$}
\blue{Explain how to solve such a problem when $c$ and $d$ are constants. Then present your solution to the mastery problem I gave you.}

\subsection{Solving the linear transport equation with polynomial coefficients}
\red{Explain how to solve such a problem when the wave speed is polynomial in $t$ or polynomial in $x$. Then demonstrate the solution with the mastery problem I gave you to solve.}

\subsection{Solving first order nonlinear PDEs using the method of characteristics}
\blue{Explain how to solve a problem of the form $u_t+g(u)u_x=0$. Then solve the mastery problem I gave you to solve. What follows is a sample use of equation array and piecewise defined functions.}
  \bea
y_{n+1} &=& y_n+\red{e} + \Delta t \lambda y_{n+1} \\
\left(1-\Delta t
\lambda\right)^ny_{n+1} &=& y_n+\red{e} \\
y_{n+1} &=& \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)(y_n+\red{e}) \\
y_{n+1} &=& \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)^{n+1}(y_0+\red{e}) 
\eea
and hence a global error after $N$ steps of
$$E = \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)^N\red{e}.$$ Therefore
$$\lim_{N\to \infty} E = \begin{cases} \infty & 
  |1-\Delta t \lambda|<1 \\
 0 &  |1-\Delta t \lambda|>1 \\
  \red{e} & |1-\Delta t \lambda|=1
  \end{cases}.$$
