\section{Numerical Methods of Solving Partial Differential Equations}
\red{Give a brief overview of this section of the class. The following would be a sample introduction to such a section from an ordinary differential equations class.}
% Don't forget to delete all of the commentary and sample code before you submit this as your Mastery Notebook.

A first order initial value problem takes the form \(\ds \d{y}{t} = f(y,t)\) with \(\ds y(t_0)=y_0\). Such functions are studied in a first class on differential equations in a variety of special cases (e.g. separable equations or linear
equations) but there is no general analytic method that works for every \(f\). We shall explore some numerical methods of finding a solution.
\subsection{Order of Error}
%\blue{Explain how you calculate the order of the error in a finite difference approximation scheme here. You should illustrate your explanation by solving at least the problem I gave you to demonstrate mastery. If you wish to include others as well that is up to you. What follows is a sample bit of text discussing the order of the error for the Euler Method of solving ODEs.} \newline

The Order of Error in a finite difference approximation tells us how fast the error term, that comes from approximating a function, changes when we increase or decease the step size.\newline

The mastery problem I was given: Approximate $u'(x)$ with $u(x)$, $u(x-3h)$, and $u(x-2h)$. What is the optimal order of error? \newline

To calculate the order of the error, we first use a Taylor Series to expand each function used to approximate the derivative except $u(x)$

\bea
u(x-3h) &=& u(x) - u'(x)(3h) + \dfrac{u''(x)(3h)^2}{2!} -  \dfrac{u'''(x)(3h)^3}{3!}+\ldots \\
u(x-2h) &=& u(x) - u'(x)(2h) + \dfrac{u''(x)(2h)^2}{2!} - \dfrac{u'''(x)(2h)^3}{3!}+\ldots
\eea

We want to solve for $u'(x)$ so lets begin by putting coefficients in front of each term in the expansions. This will allow us to combine the expansions and helps us cancel higher order terms. You need as many coefficients as you have expansions. We have 2 so we need A and B.\newline
We now have: \newline
\bea
Au(x-3h) &=& Au(x) - Au'(x)(3h) + A\dfrac{u''(x)(3h)^2}{2!} -  A\dfrac{u'''(x)(3h)^3}{3!}+\ldots \\
Bu(x-2h) &=& Bu(x) - Bu'(x)(2h) + B\dfrac{u''(x)(2h)^2}{2!} - B\dfrac{u'''(x)(2h)^3}{3!}+\ldots
\eea

Solve for A and B. We want the coefficients of each term in their expansions to add to 0. Don't include the term were solving for. In this case, don't include $u'(x)$. \newline
\bea
u(x): A + B = 0 \\
u''(x): 9A + 4B = 0 \\
\eea

The first statement is required to solve for $u'(x)$. In this case, A = -B. Let A = 1 and B = -1
Plug A and B back into the Taylor Series expansions:
\bea
u(x-3h) &=& u(x) - u'(x)(3h) + \dfrac{u''(x)(3h)^2}{2!} -  \dfrac{u'''(x)(3h)^3}{3!}+\ldots  \\
-u(x-2h) &=& -u(x) + u'(x)(2h) - \dfrac{u''(x)(2h)^2}{2!}  +\dfrac{u'''(x)(2h)^3}{3!}+\ldots  \\
\eea

Combine terms by adding or subtracting and solve for $u'(x)$. Subtract to make sure $u'(x)$ doesn't cancel and then find the first term after $u'(x)$ that doesn't cancel - that becomes the error term  \newline
\bea
u(x-3h) - -u(x-2h) = -u'(x)(h) + O(h^2) \\ 
u'(x) = -\dfrac{u(x-3h) - -u(x-2h)}{h} + \dfrac{O(h^2)}{h} \\
\eea
The order of error is h 
\newline

% through time to find an approximate solution.\\[.2in]

J. D. Lambert described the phenomenon of stiffness for a system of
differential equations as follows:
\begin{quote} If a numerical method with a finite region of absolute stability,
    applied to a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a
    certain interval of integration a steplength which is excessively small in
    relation to the smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the
    system is said to be stiff in that interval. \cite{wikistiff}
    \end{quote}
    
\section{Method of Characteristics}
%\red{Give an introduction to the method of characteristics.}
The method of characteristics is used to solve first order linear and non-linear PDEs of the form $u_t+cu_x = d$.
C can take the form of a constant or a polynomial and the equation could be homogeneous or non-homogeneous. The method of characteristics can be used to solve first order nonlinear PDEs as well, where c is a function of u. Using the method of characteristics requires an initial condition $u(0,x)=f(x)$ and that we consider what is happening with the level curves of our solution on the t,x plane. We will see what happens when c is a constant, a polynomial, and non-linear. 

\subsection{Solving $u_t+cu_x +du = g(x)$ with $u(0,x)=f(x)$}
%\blue{Explain how to solve such a problem when $c$ and $d$ are constants. Then present your solution to the mastery problem I gave you.}

First, let's consider what we know about $u(t,x)$ and $u(0,x)=f(x)$ \\

The level curves of the solution u(t,x) on the t,x plane are curves of constant value for u(t,x). No matter which point we choose on the curve, we get the same value for u(t,x). A characteristic variable $\xi$ can be introduced that we choose to define as $\xi = x-ct$. $\xi$ represents a level curve of the solution on the t,x plane where $c$ is a constant slope and $\xi$ is the x-intercept.\\

Since we know the initial condition $u(0,x) = f(x)$, we know what the solution looks like at $t=0$. If every point on our level curve gives the same value for $u(t,x)$, we can go to where $t=0$ on our level curve, which is equal to $\xi$, and know the value of the function. $\xi$ will be exactly $f$ at time 0. Therefore, $f(\xi)$ = $f(x)$ and we can plug in $\xi$ for x in the initial condition to get $u(t,x)$ \\

The mastery problem I was given: Find $u(t,x)$ given $u_t-5u_x=12$ with $u(0,x) = \dfrac{arctan(x)}{(x^2+1)}$ \\

First, solve for u(t,x) like $u_t-5u_x=12$ was homogeneous:\newline 

The level sets of the solution look like:
\bea
h = u(t,x(t)) = constant \\
\eea

Take the normal derivative of both sides:
\bea
\dfrac{dh}{dt} &=& 0  = \dfrac{du}{dt}\dfrac{dt}{dt} + \dfrac{dx}{dt}\dfrac{du}{dx}\\
\eea

This looks like the given equation when:
\bea
c &=& \dfrac{dx}{dt} = -5 \\
\xi &=& x-ct \\
\xi &=& x+5t  \\
u(t,x) &=& \dfrac{arctan(x+5t)}{((x+5t)^2+1)}  \\
\eea

Then, see what we can add on to $u(t,x)$ by considering the constant on the right side of the PDE:\\
\bea
\dfrac{dh}{dt} &=& 12 \\
h &=& 12t + g(\xi) \\ 
u(t,x) &=& \dfrac{arctan(x+5t)}{((x+5t)^2+1)} + 12t + g(\xi) \\
\eea



\subsection{Solving the linear transport equation with polynomial coefficients}
%\red{Explain how to solve such a problem when the wave speed is polynomial in $t$ or polynomial in $x$. Then demonstrate the solution with the mastery problem I gave you to solve.}
%The function u depends on t and x but x depends on t, so we can say that: \\
%\bea
%u(t,x(t)) = v = constant value \\
%\eea
We can solve linear transport equations with polynomial coefficients using the same idea as when they had constant coefficients. However, because the wave speed $c$ is not a constant, we can't find $\xi$ right away and will need to solve for it with separation of variables and integration. \newline

The mastery problem I was given: Find $u(t,x)$ given $u_t+(x^2+1)sin(t)u_x=0$ with $u(0,x) = e^{-x^2}cos(x)$ \\

The level sets of the solution look like:
\bea
h(t) = u(t,x(t)) = constant\\
\eea

Take the normal derivative of both sides:
\bea
\dfrac{dh}{dt} &=& 0  = \dfrac{du}{dt}\dfrac{dt}{dt} + \dfrac{dx}{dt}\dfrac{du}{dx}\\
\eea

This looks like the given equation when:
\bea
\dfrac{dx}{dt} &=& (x^2+1)sin(t) \\
\eea

Separation of variables:
\bea
\dfrac{dx}{(x^2+1)} &=& sin(t)dt \\
\eea

Integrate and solve for $\xi$
\bea
\int_{\xi}^{x} \dfrac{1}{(x^2+1)}dx &=& \int_{0}^{t} sin(t)dt\\
arctan(x)\Big|_\xi^x &=& -cos(t)\Big|_0^t\\
tan^{-1}(x)-tan^{-1}(\xi) &=& -cos(t) + 1\\
tan^{-1}(\xi) &=& tan^{-1}(x) + cos(t) - 1\\
\xi &=& tan(tan^{-1}(x) + cos(t) - 1)\\
\eea 


Plug back in to the initial condition $u(0,x) = e^{-x^2}cos(x)$:
\bea
u(t,x) = e^{-(tan(tan^{-1}(x) + cos(t) - 1))^2}cos(tan(tan^{-1}(x) + cos(t) - 1))\newline
\eea
In this case, there is nothing more to add on at the end because the given function was homogeneous.




\subsection{Solving first order nonlinear PDEs using the method of characteristics}

\blue{Explain how to solve a problem of the form $u_t+g(u)u_x=0$. Then solve the mastery problem I gave you to solve. What follows is a sample use of equation array and piecewise defined functions.}
  \bea
y_{n+1} &=& y_n+\red{e} + \Delta t \lambda y_{n+1} \\
\left(1-\Delta t
\lambda\right)^ny_{n+1} &=& y_n+\red{e} \\
y_{n+1} &=& \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)(y_n+\red{e}) \\
y_{n+1} &=& \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)^{n+1}(y_0+\red{e}) 
\eea
and hence a global error after $N$ steps of
$$E = \left(\frac{1}{1-\Delta t \lambda}\right)^N\red{e}.$$ Therefore
$$\lim_{N\to \infty} E = \begin{cases} \infty & 
  |1-\Delta t \lambda|<1 \\
 0 &  |1-\Delta t \lambda|>1 \\
  \red{e} & |1-\Delta t \lambda|=1
  \end{cases}.$$
